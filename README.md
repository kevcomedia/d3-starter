# d3-starter
Starter config for d3 projects

This is a bare-bones starter for d3 projects. I made this for the freeCodeCamp
d3 projects, but feel free to use it yourself.

This starter uses `eslint`, extending Google's configuration.

Stylesheets are `.scss` files by default.

## Install

Download this repo.

Go to the directory and run `npm install`.

You need to have node.js `>=8.4.0` and npm `>=5.3.0`. I'm not sure how this will
work with earlier versions.

## Start

```
npm start
```

It will run `webpack-dev-server` and open the project in a browser at
`localhost:8080`.

## Production

```
npm run build
```

## Changelog

### v1.0.1

Add Vim `*.swp` files to `.gitignore`.
